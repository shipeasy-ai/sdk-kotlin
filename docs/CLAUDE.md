# CLAUDE.md — `docs/`

This folder is the SDK's **published documentation**. It follows the cross-SDK
Shipeasy doc standard (experiment-platform `22-*` + `23-sdk-dx-standard.md`) so the
same structure exists in every Shipeasy SDK repo and can be consumed by tooling.

## How it's published

GitHub Pages serves this folder verbatim: **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a
branch → `main` / `/docs`**. Files are then fetchable raw at:

```
https://shipeasy-ai.github.io/sdk-kotlin/manifest.json
https://shipeasy-ai.github.io/sdk-kotlin/pages/<page>.md
https://shipeasy-ai.github.io/sdk-kotlin/snippets/<group>/<leaf>.md
https://shipeasy-ai.github.io/sdk-kotlin/skill/SKILL.md
```

`/.nojekyll` MUST stay — it makes Pages serve raw `.md`/JSON bytes. Three
consumers read this folder: end users (rendered on github.com), the Shipeasy
CLI/MCP `docs` op (raw fetch from Pages), and the central docs portal.

## Structure

```
docs/
├── .nojekyll                 # keep — serve raw bytes
├── manifest.json             # the index of everything (schemaVersion 2)
├── skill/SKILL.md            # installable agent skill (YAML frontmatter + guide)
├── pages/                    # feature-reference pages (FIXED key vocabulary)
└── snippets/<group>/<leaf>.md  # tiny copy-paste blocks, grouped
```

### `manifest.json`

- `sdk` — the registry name (`"kotlin"`).
- `placeholders` — `FLAG_KEY`, `CONFIG_KEY`, `KILLSWITCH_KEY`, `EXPERIMENT_KEY`,
  `EVENT_NAME`, `SUCCESS_EVENT`, `PROFILE`.
- `skill` — path to the installable skill.
- `pages` — map of page key → path. The **keys are a fixed vocabulary shared
  across all SDKs**: `overview, installation, configuration, flags, configs,
  killswitches, experiments, i18n, error-reporting, testing, openfeature,
  advanced`. Don't rename keys. (Kotlin has no OpenFeature provider — its
  `openfeature` page documents that.)
- `snippets` — nested `{ group: { leaf: path } }`. Groups: `release`, `metrics`
  (track), `i18n`, `ops` (see). Adding a snippet = add the file **and** its
  manifest entry.

### `pages/`

One feature-reference page per fixed key. Each starts with an H1 and documents
that feature for **this SDK's real API**. Written around `configure()` +
`Client(user)` — never the `Engine` (see the repo-root `CLAUDE.md`).

### `snippets/<group>/<leaf>.md`

Minimal copy-paste examples. Conventions (enforced):

- **No `configure()` call inside snippet code** — a one-line "Assumes
  `configure()` ran at startup — see Installation." note instead.
- **Construct the bound client on its own line**, with a "construct once per
  callsite" comment — never chain.
- **Document every argument** inline.
- Use the manifest's `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens, not hard-coded names.
- A file may hold a few labelled mini-snippets (`### Heading` + a block each).

### `skill/SKILL.md`

An installable Claude-Code-style skill: YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
followed by a tight usage guide. It is bundled into the jar as the classpath
resource `shipeasy-skill/SKILL.md` (kept in sync by `tools/GenReadme.java`) and
installed via `java -cp shipeasy-kotlin.jar ai.shipeasy.SkillInstallerKt install`,
so keep the frontmatter valid.

## The README is generated from these docs

`../README.md` is **generated** by `../tools/GenReadme.java` (`java
tools/GenReadme.java`, which also re-syncs the embedded skill resource). After any
doc edit, run it and commit the result; CI (`tests.yml`) fails if it drifts. Never
hand-edit the README.

## Working on the docs

- **Keep docs in lockstep with the code.** Any public API/behaviour change updates
  the matching page(s), snippet(s), and the skill in the *same* change, then
  regenerate the README.
- Confirm every `pages`/`snippets`/`skill` path the manifest lists exists.
- Prefer plain Markdown. The central portal compiles these as MDX, so avoid bare
  `<` / unescaped `{` in prose (inside code fences is fine).
- Don't restructure the fixed `pages` keys or drop `.nojekyll`.
